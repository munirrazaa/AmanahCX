## 2026-07-13 (3) — voice_bot_voices + voice_bot_custom_intents (migration 058)

- **New tables, no ALTERs** — `voice_bot_voices` (shared voice catalog, seeded with the 2
  existing Uplift voices) and `voice_bot_custom_intents` (per-tenant custom "answer, don't
  create a ticket" reasons, RLS-scoped by tenant). Applied via `npm run db:migrate` initially
  failed with `permission denied for table tenants` (FK reference needs the admin role), so
  applied manually with the admin connection string, recorded in `_migrations`, then granted
  `crm_app` SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on both new tables so the restricted role can use them
  at runtime.
- **Also fixed same day:** `TENANT_ADMIN_BLOCKED_PREFIXES` in `packages/api/src/server.ts` was
  silently blocking tenant admins from the ENTIRE `/api/v1/voice-bot` prefix (a leftover from
  before the Voice Bot admin screen was built for them) — discovered while testing the new
  endpoints, when even the pre-existing `GET /config` 403'd for a tenant admin despite the
  route itself explicitly permitting that role. Fixed by excluding `/api/v1/voice-bot` from
  the wall (every route in that file already gates itself correctly per-route). A second bug
  in the same fix: `/api/v1/voice-bot` also matched the separate, unrelated `/api/v1/voice`
  block by prefix (`startsWith`) — added an explicit early exemption so the two don't collide.

## 2026-07-13 (2) — voice_bot_configs.bot_name (migration 050) + Haier passwords restored + 049/050 applied to live DB

- **Migration 049 APPLIED to Supabase** (it was pending in the morning entry below): applied
  manually with the admin (postgres) connection and recorded in `_migrations`, after Railway's
  auto-migration failed the 05:07 deploy — the app's restricted `crm_app` role cannot ALTER
  tables it doesn't own. **Process rule going forward:** ALTER-ing migrations must be applied
  manually + recorded BEFORE pushing, or the deploy fails its healthcheck.
- **Migration 050 applied + recorded** the same way: `voice_bot_configs.bot_name TEXT NOT NULL
  DEFAULT 'Nadia'` — per-tenant display name for the self-hosted voice bot, editable from the
  new Voice Bot admin screen.
- **Passwords restored for the 5 `haier-electronics` users** (admin@…, sarah.manager@…,
  mike.linemanager@…, amir.agent@…, zoya.agent@…) to the owner's documented values — the
  2026-07-12 all-users diagnostic reset had orphaned them, which turned out to be why the
  owner "couldn't log in since yesterday". Verified with a real login against production.

## 2026-07-13 — voice_bot_configs: LiveKit agent columns + sip_uri/ivr_menu bug fix (migration 049)

### What changed
`ALTER TABLE voice_bot_configs` (all idempotent `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`):
- `sip_uri TEXT`, `ivr_menu JSONB` — these were already referenced by `PUT /config` in
  `voice-bot.ts` but no migration had ever created them; every save of those two fields has
  been failing with "column does not exist" since they were added to the route.
- New LiveKit-specific columns: `tone`, `speaking_rate`, `stt_provider`, `stt_language_hint`,
  `tts_provider`, `llm_model`, `interruption_sensitivity`, `max_call_duration_sec`,
  `end_call_phrases`, `sip_trunk_provider`, `sip_trunk_number` — config knobs for the new
  self-hosted "Nadia" LiveKit voice agent (see `CHANGE_LOG.md` 2026-07-13), equivalent to what
  Retell AI/Vapi's own dashboards expose for a hosted agent.

### Why
The self-hosted LiveKit agent has no vendor dashboard of its own — the CRM's Voice Bot Config
screen has to be that dashboard, so it needs columns for the settings a hosted platform would
otherwise store on their side.

### Filename-numbering note (resolves the ambiguity flagged in the 2026-07-12 entry below)
Checked `_migrations` directly before writing this: no row for `049`, `050`, `051`, or `052`
exists in the live database — filename `049_livekit_agent_config.sql` does not collide with
anything already applied. The gap between `048` and `053` in the live history is unexplained
by this session but confirmed harmless for this migration.

### Verification
**Not yet applied** — file exists at
`packages/core/src/database/migrations/049_livekit_agent_config.sql`, `npm run db:migrate`
has not been run against Supabase yet. Do that before relying on the new columns; the
migration is purely additive so it's safe to run at any time.

## 2026-07-12 — No structural database changes

- Application-code-only push (quick-capture validation, mobile UX fixes). Password reset on non-protected test user field.officer@demo.com (rotated by a parallel session, reset to documented test value).

---

## 2026-07-12 — New table: contact_channel_consent (migration 053)

### What changed
New append-only table `contact_channel_consent` for per-channel communication consent:
`id, tenant_id (FK tenants), contact_id (FK contacts), channel (whatsapp|sms|email),
opted_in (bool), source (manual|reply|form|import|api), consented_at, recorded_by (FK users,
SET NULL on delete), notes`. Two indexes for latest-state and history lookups. RLS enabled
with the standard `tenant_isolation` policy (`app.tenant_id` GUC or `app.bypass_rls`).

### Why
Meta's WhatsApp Business API requires provable customer opt-in before business-initiated
messages (account-suspension risk). Rows are never updated or deleted by the application —
every opt-in/opt-out is a new row, preserving the compliance audit trail.

### Verification
Applied via Supabase migration `053_contact_channel_consent` and live-tested the same day:
insert/read through the API under a tenant-scoped connection works; a different tenant's
manager receives an empty result for the same contact (RLS isolation confirmed); mirrored in
repo at `packages/core/src/database/migrations/053_contact_channel_consent.sql`.

Note: migration numbering — the repo also contains an unrelated, not-yet-committed
`049_livekit_agent_config.sql` in the AmanahCX working tree (separate voice-agent work, not
part of this change); crm-platform's local sequence runs 049–052 with different content.
The Supabase migration history is the authoritative record of what is applied to the live DB.

## 2026-07-11 — Attachments table + field-officer test account (cloud DB)

- **`attachments` table** (lazy-created by the API on boot if missing): id, tenant_id, entity_type, entity_id, filename, mime_type, size_bytes, storage_key, uploaded_by, created_at + index on (tenant_id, entity_type, entity_id). Stores photos/files attached to deals/contacts/tickets from the mobile app. Files themselves live in the file-storage backend (local dir in dev; S3-compatible in production).
- **Test user `field.officer@demo.com`** (role agent, dept Sales, reports to sales line manager) inserted directly into the Supabase cloud DB for mobile field testing — not one of the locked demo accounts. Password documented in session notes only.
- **Seeded test data:** contact "Kamran Siddiqui" + 3 field activities assigned to the field officer (demo tenant). Activity `metadata` now carries `checkins[]` (GPS arrivals) and `completedLocation` (GPS at completion) written by the new check-in/complete endpoints.

## 2026-07-10 — Critical: Restricted the app's database login (tenant isolation fix)

### What changed
The application's database connection was switched from the `postgres` superuser role to a
restricted, non-superuser role (`crm_app`).

### Why
Row-Level Security (RLS) policies enforcing tenant data isolation were present and correctly
written in the database, but were being silently ignored. In Postgres, any role with `SUPERUSER`
or `BYPASSRLS` ignores RLS policies entirely, even ones created with `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`.
The app's connection (`postgres`) had `rolbypassrls = true`. This meant tenant isolation was not
actually enforced at the database layer in production — verified directly: querying
`ticket_queues` with the tenant context correctly set still returned a different tenant's row.

This was discovered while testing ticket creation for a new tenant: its tickets were being
auto-assigned to another tenant's default queue, because the "pick the default queue" query
wasn't (and didn't need to be, under normal RLS) filtered by tenant — RLS was supposed to do
that filtering automatically and wasn't.

### What was done
1. Confirmed `crm_app` already existed as a properly-configured role (`NOSUPERUSER`,
   `NOBYPASSRLS`, `LOGIN`) with grants on all 59 tables at the time — likely provisioned in an
   earlier session but never actually connected to the running app.
2. Reset its password and granted:
   - `USAGE`, `CREATE` on schema `public`
   - `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` on all tables (existing + future, via `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`)
   - `USAGE, SELECT` on all sequences (existing + future)
3. Transferred ownership of the 4 analytics materialized views (`mv_daily_deal_stats`,
   `mv_daily_ticket_stats`, `mv_contact_source_stats`, `mv_daily_activity_stats`) and the
   `team_messages` table to `crm_app` — Postgres requires actual ownership (not just a grant) to
   run `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` or `CREATE INDEX` on an existing object.
   - `team_messages` has RLS disabled entirely (`relrowsecurity = false`), so this ownership
     transfer does not affect its isolation posture either way.
4. Updated `DATABASE_URL` in both the local dev environment and the live Railway production
   environment to connect as `crm_app` (via the Supabase connection pooler, matching the exact
   host/port pattern already in use, with the pooler's required `crm_app.<project-ref>` username
   format).
5. Recorded the change as a proper, idempotent migration: `048_restricted_app_role.sql`
   (in `packages/core/src/database/migrations/`), and inserted a matching row into `_migrations`
   with today's date, since the underlying change had already been applied manually before the
   migration file existed.

### Verification
- **Before fix:** direct query (tenant context correctly set to Tenant A) for
  `SELECT id FROM ticket_queues WHERE is_default = true LIMIT 1` returned Tenant B's queue.
- **After fix:** the identical query, run as `crm_app`, correctly returned zero rows for a
  tenant with no queues of its own.
- **Live app confirmation:** re-tested the actual ticket-claim workflow end-to-end against the
  live production Railway deployment (not a local copy) after switching its `DATABASE_URL` —
  confirmed working correctly (an agent could claim a ticket that was previously blocked by the
  cross-tenant leak).
- Normal reads/writes re-verified unaffected: a tenant's own tickets and contacts are still
  fully visible and editable under the new role.

### Rollback note
If this ever needs to be reverted (it should not be), the old `DATABASE_URL` pointed at the
`postgres` role. Reverting would immediately reopen the tenant-isolation gap described above —
do not revert without a replacement fix in place first.

## 2026-07-10 — Housekeeping: migration file duplicates removed

### What changed
Removed 3 duplicate migration files, confirmed byte-for-byte identical to their originals via `diff`:
- `023_tenant_entitlements 2.sql` (duplicate of `023_tenant_entitlements.sql`)
- `024_ticket_deal_link 2.sql` (duplicate of `024_ticket_deal_link.sql`)
- `025_default_departments 2.sql` (duplicate of `025_default_departments.sql`)

### Why
Cosmetic clutter only — both the tracked `_migrations` table and the actual live schema already
agreed with each other (47/47 match, contrary to an outdated note from an earlier session
suggesting drift existed — that drift had already been separately resolved before this check).

### Impact
None. No schema change. The non-duplicate originals were already applied and remain applied.

## Earlier migrations (001–047)

See `packages/core/src/database/migrations/` for the full ordered list. Notable structural
migrations: `012_line_manager` (manager_id / reporting hierarchy), `018_departments_and_opportunities`,
`023_tenant_entitlements`, `024_ticket_deal_link`, `025_default_departments`, `030_sla_enhancements`,
`033_sla_pause` (business hour profiles), `044_voice_bot_self_service`, `045_quotations`,
`046_dept_type_nullable`, `047_sla_time_unit`. Each is idempotent and safe to re-run.
